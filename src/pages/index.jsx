      This is the front-page of the blog. 👾  
    </p>
    <p>
      you can sign-in, Post and see the list of posts and even delete you're own post. 💻
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all. Simple. 🤷‍♂️
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there is an <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">Admin</span>. Who knows what he can do... 👀
    </p>
  </div>

export default IndexPage
